    Why this is a Good UX Strategy
    Engagement-first: Users don’t stare at a static loader, they see brand content immediately.
    Smooth transition: Fading keeps it cinematic instead of jumpy.
    Attention funnel: Video = hook → images = depth → text = CTA.
    Modern feel: Animations + microinteractions make site look premium.
    Case 2: Changing Video Weekly

Pros

Keeps the site fresh → even repeat visitors don’t get bored.

Seasonal promotions, new dishes, or events can be highlighted.

Adds “living brand” feel (not a static site).

Cons

You’ll need to encode + optimize a new video each week (time-consuming).

If videos aren’t consistent in quality or size, performance may vary.

Frequent CDN cache invalidations if you host globally.
