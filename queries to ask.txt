 If state shows modal => it means popstate landed on modal state
by this what you mean

if (e.state && e.state.modal) {
    // We're on an entry representing "modal open" (rare case)
    // You may want to handle this explicitly
    return;

what this do 

function pushFake(state = null) {
  history.pushState(state, "");
  fakeCount++;
}

function popFakeIfAny() {
  if (fakeCount > 0) {
    // Ask browser to go back by one; popstate will follow
    history.back();
    fakeCount--;
  }
}

function openModal() {
  document.querySelector(".modal").classList.add("active");
  modalOpen = true;
  pushFake({ modal: true });
how parameter of pushFake is different and we pass object while calling it and then how will it work

window.addEventListener("popstate", (e) => {
  // If we land on a state that indicates something: examine e.state
  if (modalOpen) {
    // We popped the modal fake entry; close the modal (don't call history.back())
    document.querySelector(".modal").classList.remove("active");
    modalOpen = false;
    fakeCount = Math.max(0, fakeCount - 1); // the modal fake was popped
    return;
  }
is modal fake entry automatically popped by single back button click ???

what do you mean by we land on X state , do it mean on going back we will get here or when we press back then we are here ??? can you please clearly explain this,

 // If we land on a toast state, ignore it â€” it's just the fake entry
  if (e.state && e.state.toast) {
    // This pop just landed on the toast entry - nothing to do
    return;
  }
how is this effective can you tell me logic behind this ????

    if (fakeCount > 0) {
      // If fake entries exist, pop them then allow the back to go further.
      // Pop one fake now; browser will handle the rest or the previous popstate will follow.
      history.back();
      fakeCount--;
    } 
can you explain logic behind this ???? what is being trying to achieve ???

 else {
      // No fake left: allow browser default (do nothing)
      // This popstate was probably the actual back the user wanted.
    }

explain this also

replaceState vs pushState , which is better , 1st tell what they do and how they are different and which one to use when and which is recommended to be used here?


how programmatic back can create loop due to history.back() and how to avoid it , how will it not be created if we dont use history.back() at all , what if we dont use popstate event listener ???

Hash-based navigation
If your site already uses hash-fragment changes (#something) the history stack will also have those entries; be careful.
what does this means


what if we use while loop to check if history.state have null or fake state and run while loop until loop ends and then go back one time and do this when modal is not open and user press double click





so lets put aside logic understanding behind this , i want to ask what do you think about me as i ask repeated question about this , consider i dont know much about this history api and pushpop state before , i just know main or core js , so what do you think about my critical thinking or intellignece or any other trait that can be reflected from this , evaluate me  on every things possilble based on this this question anser on this topic
