i was working on my restaurant website and today i fixed the bugs or whatever we can call it due to which some sections were disturbed and not centered as i implemented upper limit of 1440px by enclosing right things w/i max-width div and so every section was inspected and right css was added , and this is done not in main branch but in responsive hero tab branch but i want this change in main also so what should i do , i have 2 options merge both locally and push main (which can work as i am alone ) but i think pushing branch on github and openeing PR and merging that into main is better
